# Socios Constitución Component - Image Loading Fixes

## Issue Resolved
The component was attempting to load images multiple times, causing console errors and performance issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Partner Interface
- Added `imageLoaded?: boolean` and `imageError?: boolean` properties to track image state
- This prevents multiple error attempts and provides better state management

### 2. Improved Image Error Handling
- Added `onImageLoad()` method to track successful image loads
- Modified `onImageError()` to prevent multiple error attempts
- Added guard clause to prevent repeated error handling for the same image

### 3. Better HTML Template
- Added `(load)` event handler to track successful image loads
- Added `(error)` event handler with partner parameter
- Added conditional display styling to hide failed images
- Added placeholder div for failed images with "Imagen no disponible" text

### 4. Placeholder Styling
- Added CSS for `.image-placeholder` with dashed border and centered text
- Consistent styling that matches the card design
- Responsive design maintained

### 5. Animation Optimization
- Reduced animation duration from 0.6s to 0.4s
- Reduced transform distance from 20px to 10px
- Less aggressive animations to prevent multiple triggers

## Current Image Sources
- Using placeholder.com URLs for demonstration
- FOVIS: Green placeholder with text
- SERVIDONMATÍAS: Blue placeholder with text

## How to Replace with Real Images

1. **Add real images to `src/assets/images/`**:
   - `fovis-housing-project.jpg`
   - `servidonmatias-water-project.jpg`

2. **Update the component**:
   ```typescript
   image: 'assets/images/fovis-housing-project.jpg',
   ```

3. **Or use external URLs**:
   ```typescript
   image: 'https://your-domain.com/images/fovis-project.jpg',
   ```

## Error Handling Features
- Graceful fallback when images fail to load
- Prevents infinite loading loops
- Clean placeholder display for failed images
- No console spam from repeated error attempts

## Testing
- Build successful with `ng build`
- Component renders correctly with or without images
- Error handling works as expected
- Responsive design maintained
