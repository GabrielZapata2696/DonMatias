# Image Optimization Guide

## Problem
The slider component on the Netlify-hosted website was loading images too slowly due to large file sizes (main-park-project.png: 11.35 MB, main-road-project.png: 11.32 MB).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Image Format Optimization
- **Converted PNG to WebP**: Achieved up to 98% file size reduction
- **Created responsive image variants**: Desktop and mobile versions
- **Generated optimized JPEG fallbacks**: For browsers that don't support WebP

#### File Size Reductions:
- `main-park-project.png`: 11.35 MB → 0.21 MB WebP (98% reduction)
- `main-road-project.png`: 11.32 MB → 0.22 MB WebP (98% reduction)
- Mobile versions: Even smaller at ~0.04 MB each

### 2. Responsive Image Implementation
Updated the slider component to use the HTML `<picture>` element with:
- **WebP format for modern browsers** (mobile and desktop)
- **JPEG fallbacks** for older browsers
- **Responsive images** based on screen size (768px breakpoint)
- **Proper media queries** for optimal image selection

### 3. Smart Image Preloading
Implemented advanced preloading strategies:
- **Priority-based loading**: First image loads immediately
- **Adjacent image preloading**: Next/previous images preload on navigation
- **Progressive loading**: High priority → Medium → Low priority
- **Intelligent caching**: Prevents duplicate loading

### 4. Performance Optimizations
Enhanced CSS and component behavior:
- **Hardware acceleration**: `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change: transform`
- **Optimized transitions**: Only active images have transitions
- **Better image rendering**: `image-rendering: crisp-edges`
- **Lazy loading**: Native browser lazy loading for non-critical images

### 5. Image Preloader Service
Created a dedicated service (`ImagePreloaderService`) that:
- **Detects WebP support** automatically
- **Handles mobile/desktop variants** intelligently
- **Manages loading priorities** (high/medium/low)
- **Provides caching** to prevent duplicate requests
- **Includes error handling** and fallback mechanisms

## Files Modified

### Core Component Files:
- `src/app/features/home/components/image-slider/image-slider.component.ts`
- `src/app/features/home/components/image-slider/image-slider.component.html`
- `src/app/features/home/components/image-slider/image-slider.component.css`

### New Files Created:
- `src/app/core/services/image-preloader.service.ts`
- `optimize-images.js` (build tool)
- `public/imagenes/optimized/` (optimized image directory)

## Usage Instructions

### Running Image Optimization
```bash
# Install Sharp for image processing
npm install sharp --save-dev

# Run the optimization script
node optimize-images.js
```

### Deploying to Netlify
1. Ensure all optimized images are in `public/imagenes/optimized/`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Deploy the `dist/brochure` folder to Netlify

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization:
- Large images: 11+ MB each
- Slow loading times on mobile networks
- Poor user experience

### After Optimization:
- Reduced file sizes by 98%
- Faster loading on all devices
- Progressive loading for smooth UX
- WebP support for modern browsers
- Responsive images for different screen sizes

## Browser Support
- **WebP**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (modern versions)
- **JPEG fallback**: All browsers
- **Picture element**: All modern browsers
- **Lazy loading**: Native support in modern browsers

## Monitoring
Use browser dev tools to verify:
1. **Network tab**: Check which image format is loaded
2. **Performance tab**: Measure loading times
3. **Lighthouse**: Web performance score improvements

## Future Enhancements
- Implement blur placeholder loading
- Add AVIF format support
- Consider CDN integration
- Add image dimension optimization based on actual display size
